# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis.

## 1. **Project Overview**
### **Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to analyze customer purchase behavior using an **E-Commerce sales dataset**. The analysis will help uncover patterns in customer spending, product demand, and market trends, leading to actionable business insights.

### **Dataset Description**
The dataset used for this project, "Online Retail 2.xlsx," consists of transactional data from an online retail store. It contains details such as **invoice number, product description, quantity, price, customer ID, invoice date, and country** of purchase.

## 2. **Business Goals**
- **Understand customer purchase behavior** to improve marketing strategies.
- **Identify best-selling products** and optimize inventory management.

## 3. **Project Workflow**

### **Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Load the dataset from an Excel file.
- Handle missing values and duplicates.
- Convert data types for accurate analysis.
- Remove canceled transactions (negative quantities).

### **Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Identify **top-selling products** based on quantity sold.
- Analyze **monthly sales trends** to detect seasonal patterns.
- Identify **top revenue-generating countries**.
- Visualize **customer distribution** by frequency and spending.

### **Step 3: Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)**
- Compute **Recency** (days since last purchase), **Frequency** (number of purchases), and **Monetary** (total revenue contribution) for each customer.
- Assign **RFM scores** to categorize customers into loyalty tiers (e.g., VIPs, churn risks, occasional buyers).

### **Step 4: Business Insights & Recommendations**
- Identify peak sales periods and **suggest promotional strategies**.
- Determine high-value customers and recommend **loyalty programs**.
- Analyze country-wise sales performance for **market expansion strategies**.

### **Step 5: Data Visualization & Reporting**
- Create interactive charts and graphs using **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly**.
